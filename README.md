# Face-Detection-App
This Face Detection App, built with OpenCV and Streamlit, captures video from a webcam, detects faces using a Haar Cascade Classifier, and enables users to adjust detection parameters (scaleFactor, minNeighbors) and rectangle colors. Users can save images with detected faces, with an interactive web interface for ease of use.
